# Security Audit Report: Aminals Protocol

## Executive Summary

This security audit has identified **CRITICAL vulnerabilities** in the Aminals protocol that allow unauthorized ETH drainage from any Aminal contract. The main issue is in the `payBreedingFee` function which lacks any authorization checks. **UPDATE: All critical vulnerabilities have been fixed as of 2025-07-06.**

### Severity Ratings
- ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**: Immediate exploitation possible, significant financial loss
- ðŸŸ  **HIGH**: Significant security risk requiring urgent fix
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: Security concern that should be addressed
- ðŸŸ¢ **LOW**: Minor issue or best practice recommendation

### Audit Status
- **Initial Audit Date**: 2025-07-06
- **Fix Implementation Date**: 2025-07-06
- **Status**: âœ… ALL CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Unauthorized ETH Drainage via payBreedingFee âœ… FIXED

**Location**: `Aminal.sol:522-554`

**Description**: The `payBreedingFee` function can be called by ANY external address to drain 10% of an Aminal's ETH balance per call. There are NO authorization checks.

**Proof of Concept**:
```solidity
// Any attacker can repeatedly steal funds
address[] memory recipients = new address[](1);
recipients[0] = attacker;

// Drain 10% each time
aminal.payBreedingFee(recipients, 123); // Steals 10% of balance
aminal.payBreedingFee(recipients, 456); // Steals 10% of remaining
aminal.payBreedingFee(recipients, 789); // Steals 10% of remaining
```

**Impact**: 
- Complete theft of all ETH from any Aminal
- Attacker can drain funds in ~20 transactions
- No way to prevent or recover stolen funds

**Fix Implemented**:
```solidity
function payBreedingFee(
    address[] calldata recipients,
    uint256 breedingTicketId
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 totalPaid) {
    // SECURITY: Verify caller is the authorized breeding vote contract
    address breedingVoteContract = AminalFactory(factory).breedingVoteContract();
    require(
        msg.sender == breedingVoteContract,
        "Only authorized breeding vote contract"
    );
    
    // SECURITY: Verify this Aminal is actually part of the breeding ticket
    require(
        IAminalBreedingVote(breedingVoteContract).isParentInTicket(breedingTicketId, address(this)),
        "Aminal not part of this breeding"
    );
    
    // Additional security measures added...
}
```

### 2. ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: No Breeding Ticket Validation âœ… FIXED

**Location**: `Aminal.sol:525`

**Description**: The `breedingTicketId` parameter is never validated. Attackers can pass any value.

**Impact**: Even with authorization, there's no verification that this Aminal is involved in the specified breeding.

**Fix Implemented**: Added `isParentInTicket()` validation to ensure the Aminal is actually parent1 or parent2 in the breeding ticket.

### 3. ðŸŸ  HIGH: Reentrancy Vulnerability âœ… FIXED

**Location**: `Aminal.sol:540-551`

**Description**: The `payBreedingFee` function uses `.call{}` without reentrancy protection.

**Fix Implemented**: Added `nonReentrant` modifier to the function signature.

### 4. ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: tx.origin Usage âœ… FIXED

**Location**: `AminalBreedingVote.sol:351`

**Description**: Uses `tx.origin` which can be manipulated and breaks composability.

**Fix Implemented**: Changed from `tx.origin` to `msg.sender` for tracking the breeding skill contract.

## Additional Security Concerns

### 5. ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: Insufficient Skill Validation

**Location**: `Aminal.sol:366-411`

**Description**: While skills check the ISkill interface, there's no whitelist of trusted skills.

**Recommendation**: Consider implementing a skill registry or whitelist.

### 6. ðŸŸ¢ LOW: Gene Proposal Spam

**Location**: `AminalBreedingVote.sol`

**Description**: Low barrier (100 love units) allows spam proposals.

**Recommendation**: Increase minimum requirement or add rate limiting.

## Exploit Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Direct Theft
1. Attacker identifies valuable Aminals with high ETH balance
2. Calls `payBreedingFee` repeatedly with their address
3. Drains 10% per call until balance is negligible

### Scenario 2: Front-Running Breeding
1. Attacker monitors for breeding executions
2. Front-runs with `payBreedingFee` calls
3. Legitimate gene owners receive less/nothing

### Scenario 3: Automated Bot Attack
1. Bot scans all Aminals for ETH balance
2. Automatically drains any with balance > gas cost
3. Scales attack across entire protocol

## Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Actions (CRITICAL)

1. **Add Authorization to payBreedingFee**:
```solidity
// Option 1: Hardcode breeding vote contract
address public immutable breedingVoteContract;

// Option 2: Maintain whitelist
mapping(address => bool) public authorizedCallers;

// Option 3: Use factory for verification
modifier onlyAuthorizedBreeding() {
    require(
        factory.isAuthorizedBreedingContract(msg.sender),
        "Unauthorized"
    );
    _;
}
```

2. **Validate Breeding Involvement**:
```solidity
function payBreedingFee(
    address[] calldata recipients,
    uint256 breedingTicketId
) external onlyAuthorizedBreeding nonReentrant returns (uint256 totalPaid) {
    // Callback to breeding vote to verify involvement
    require(
        IAminalBreedingVote(msg.sender).isParentInTicket(
            breedingTicketId,
            address(this)
        ),
        "Not parent in breeding"
    );
    // ... rest of function
}
```

3. **Add Reentrancy Protection**:
```solidity
import {ReentrancyGuard} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

// Add nonReentrant modifier to payBreedingFee
```

### Medium Priority Fixes

1. **Remove tx.origin usage**
2. **Implement skill registry/whitelist**
3. **Increase gene proposal requirements**
4. **Add event monitoring for suspicious activity**

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Security Test Suite**: Add comprehensive security tests
2. **Fuzzing**: Fuzz test payment amounts and recipient arrays
3. **Invariant Testing**: Ensure ETH can only flow out during legitimate breeding
4. **Fork Testing**: Test on mainnet fork with real data

## Conclusion

The current implementation has critical vulnerabilities that allow complete theft of funds from any Aminal. These must be fixed immediately before any deployment. The main issue is the complete lack of authorization on the `payBreedingFee` function.

The recommended fix is straightforward: add proper authorization checks and validate breeding ticket involvement. With these fixes, the breeding fee payment system can work as intended without compromising security.

## Fix Implementation Summary

### Architecture Changes

1. **Aminal Contract**:
   - Added `factory` immutable variable to store factory address
   - Modified constructor to accept factory address as 5th parameter
   - Updated `payBreedingFee` with full security implementation

2. **Factory Contract**:
   - Added `breedingVoteContract` state variable
   - Added `setBreedingVoteContract()` one-time setter function
   - Updated `_createAminal` to pass factory address to new Aminals

3. **Breeding Vote Contract**:
   - Added `isParentInTicket()` public view function
   - Removed `tx.origin` usage in favor of `msg.sender`

### Security Measures Implemented

âœ… **Authorization System**:
- Factory tracks the authorized breeding vote contract
- Aminals verify caller through factory lookup
- One-time setting prevents authorization changes

âœ… **Ticket Validation**:
- `isParentInTicket()` ensures Aminal is actually involved
- Prevents drainage using arbitrary ticket IDs

âœ… **Reentrancy Protection**:
- `nonReentrant` modifier on all payment functions
- Follows checks-effects-interactions pattern

âœ… **Input Validation**:
- Recipient address validation (no address(0))
- Recipient count limits (max 50 to prevent gas griefing)
- Minimum payment thresholds

### Testing Recommendations

1. Verify unauthorized calls revert with "Only authorized breeding vote contract"
2. Test reentrancy attempts fail gracefully
3. Confirm invalid ticket IDs are rejected
4. Test gas limits with maximum recipients
5. Verify factory authorization cannot be changed once set

### Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to mainnet:
- [ ] Set breeding vote contract in factory after deployment
- [ ] Verify all Aminals created have correct factory reference
- [ ] Run full security test suite
- [ ] Audit event emissions for monitoring
- [ ] Confirm no `tx.origin` usage remains
- [ ] Test integration with existing breeding system
